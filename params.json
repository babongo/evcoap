{"body":"### What is it\r\nEvcoap aims at providing a fully compliant implementation of the [CoAP protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap), of its discovery companion [Link-Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690), and of the pretty useful [Observe](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe) and [Block](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block) options.\r\n\r\nEvcoap is based on [Libevent 2.x](http://libevent.org) by Niels Provos and Nick Mathewson, and shares much of the design philosophy found in its evhttp front-end.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nOur final goal is to give libevent users a robust set of tools for creating compliant CoAP-based applications including, but not limited to, [HTTP-CoAP interworking proxies](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-castellani-core-http-mapping), [Resource Directories](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shelby-core-resource-directory), etc., that can equally run on UNIX, Mac and Windows systems.\r\n\r\n### Project Documentation\r\nIn a not so distant future you will hopefully find design documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/babongo/evcoap/wiki) pages.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFounding project members are @yrz, @salvatoreloreto, and @babongo.","note":"Don't delete this file!
